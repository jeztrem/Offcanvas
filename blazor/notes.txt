IndexChildParentBinding  
    binds data (private on this side, not a property.)
    @bind-{Property}:after="method" nice way to call a method after child has completed its work.

ChildParentBinding
    has properties
    has parameters as properties (exposes them to the parent)
    needs to specify EventCallBack so when OnPropertyChanged is called, it can update the object.

For this to bind DayItem, they would need to call the same class (don't define inside @code.)    

Beware of rules for refreshing component.  
    If you have a property that is not a parameter, it will not refresh the component.  
    You need to call StateHasChanged().
